In this project, I will use the .xnb files from Stardew Valley's metadata and .xml files representing a user's saved game to create a tool that tracks the player's progress in the end-game goal of reaching "perfection" (catching all fish, cooking and crafting all recipes, completing the community center or JojaMart projects, etc.) This tool works offline and only requires data exported from local Stardew Valley installations.
